# Ansible Roles Depot

The roles in this repository are not meant to be usable in a general way and are
adjusted to my personal preferences and environments. I use them in my playbooks
by adding the repo itself as a Git submodule and symlinking roles I want in the
respective playbook into the roles directory.
